The distance to the nearest road for 26 trees (\"Tree_A\" through \"Tree_Z\")\n    2. The percent cover of the three major lichen types on 10 of those trees \n\n\\\n\n. . .\n\n- Any questions on this study or these example datasets?\n\n## [Practice: Left Joins]{.pink} {.smaller}\n\n![](images/hex-dplyr.png){.absolute top=0 left=1100 width=\"12%\" fig-alt=\"hex logo for the dplyr R package\"}\n\n- Download the \"tree_lichen.csv\" and \"tree_road.csv\" from the course page\n\n\\\n\n. . . \n\n- Load them into R and check their structure\n    - Remember to use the `read.csv` function\n\n\n\\\n\n. . .\n\n- Use a [**left** join]{.purple} to combine these two dataframes by tree ID\n    - What is the structure of the resulting dataframe?\n\n## [Inner Joins]{.orange}\n\n- Inner joins keep columns from both left and right **but** only rows that are _found in both_\n    - Useful when you only want to keep rows with complete data\n\n. . .\n\n<img src=\"images/graphic-join-inner.png\" alt=\"Table with an 'X' column and 'A' and 'B' rows gets joined with a second table with a 'Y' column and 'A' and 'C' rows to produce a single table with 'X' and Y' columns and only an 'A' row\" width=\"95%\">\n\n## [Outer Joins]{.orange} {.smaller}\n\n- Outer joins keep columns from both left and right **and** _all rows_ \n\n. . .\n\n<img src=\"images/graphic-join-outer.png\" alt=\"Table with an 'X' column and 'A' and 'B' rows gets joined with a second table with a 'Y' column and 'A' and 'C' rows to produce a single table with 'X' and Y' columns and 'A', 'B', and 'C' rows\" width=\"95%\">\n\n. . .\n\n- This join type is also known as a \"full join\" or \"full outer join\"\n\n## [Revisiting Lichen Data]{.gold}\n\n- You decide to revisit your lichen / tree study\n\n\\\n\n. . .\n\n- Now you want to keep the tree road distances _whether or not_ you have lichen cover\n\n\\\n\n. . .\n\n- What kind of join should you use? Why?\n\n## [Practice: Inner/Outer Joins]{.pink}\n\n![](images/hex-dplyr.png){.absolute top=0 left=1100 width=\"12%\" fig-alt=\"hex logo for the dplyr R package\"}\n\n- Use a [full join]{.purple} to combine the original lichen and road distance objects\n\n\\\n\n. . .\n\n- What is the structure of the resulting dataframe?\n\n\\\n\n. . .\n\n- How does this differ from the result of your **left** join earlier?\n\n## [Anti Joins]{.orange}\n\n- Anti joins keep columns from both left and right **but** only rows that are _**not**_ found in both\n\n. . .\n\n<img src=\"images/graphic-join-anti.png\" alt=\"Table with an 'X' column and 'A' and 'B' rows gets joined with a second table with a 'Y' column and 'A' and 'C' rows to produce a single table with 'X' and Y' columns 'B' and 'C' rows\" width=\"95%\">\n\n## [Re-revisiting Lichen Data]{.gold} {.smaller}\n\n- You have just been awarded a grant to conduct more lichen research!\n    - Congratulations!\n\n\\\n\n. . .\n\n- You decide to spend your grant on measuring lichen on all of the trees that you <u>did not</u> measure the first time\n\n\\\n\n. . . \n\n- You need to join your old datasets to identify which trees you should measure with your new grant\n    - What kind of join should you use? Why?\n\n## [Practice: Anti Joins]{.pink} {.smaller}\n\n![](images/hex-dplyr.png){.absolute top=0 left=1100 width=\"12%\" fig-alt=\"hex logo for the dplyr R package\"}\n\n- Use an [anti join]{.purple} to combine the original lichen and road distance objects\n\n\\\n\n- Which dataframe should be on the \"left\" and which should be \"right\"?\n    - Does it matter?\n\n\\\n\n. . .\n\n- How many trees do you need to measure lichen on with your new funding?\n\n## [Join Trivia - Question 1]{.gold} {.smaller}\n\n- I have a table of [scorpion abundance]{.orange} and another of [desert temperatures]{.orange}\n\n\\\n\n. . .\n\n- I want to keep only scorpion values that _also_ have temperature\n    - Which type of join should I use?\n\n\\\n\n. . .\n\n- Inner join!\n    - Keeps only rows found in both dataframes\n\n## [Join Trivia - Question 2]{.gold} {.smaller}\n\n- I have a table of [bird species]{.orange} and another of [grass species]{.orange} at various plots\n\n\\\n\n. . .\n\n- I want to include all birds and grasses _regardless_ of whether both are in each plot\n    - Which type of join should I use?\n\n\\\n\n. . .\n\n- Full join!\n    - Keeps **all** rows found in either dataframe\n\n## [Join Trivia - Question 3]{.gold} {.smaller}\n\n- I have a table of [patient response to medication]{.orange} and another of [patients who indicated they don't want their data used]{.orange}\n\n\\\n\n. . .\n\n- I want to _remove_ medication response information for all patients who didn't give consent to use their data\n    - Which type of join should I use?\n\n\\\n\n. . .\n\n- Anti join!\n    - Keeps only rows **not** found in both data tables\n\n## [Temperature Check]{.purple}\n\n#### How are you Feeling?\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"comics/debugging.png\" alt=\"Comic-style graph depicting someone's emotional state as they debug code (from initial struggle and defeat to eventual triumph)\">\n</p>\n\n## [Function Tutorial Assignment]{.gold} {.smaller}\n\n- Picking functions today!\n\n\\\n\n- Take a moment and get your 7-10 functions list ready\n    - You may also want to pull up CRAN (just in case)\n\n\\\n\n- Any lingering questions about this assignment?\n    - Esp. any that need to be answered _before_ picking functions\n\n## [Randomizing Vectors]{.orange} {.smaller}\n\n- We'll use the `sample` function to randomize student order\n\n\\\n\n. . . \n\n- `sample` has three main arguments:\n    - `x` = vector to randomize\n    - `size` = number of times to randomly sample\n    - `replace` = whether vector elements can be retrieved more than once\n\n\\\n\n. . .\n\n- In our case:\n    - `x` = vector of student names\n    - `size` = number of students\n    - `replace` = `FALSE` (don't want to double pick the same student)\n\n## [Randomizing Vectors Demo]{.orange}\n\n- Let's look at an example to clarify that\n\n```{.r code-line-numbers=\"|2|5\"}\n# Make a vector of faux students\nstudents <- c(\"albatross\", \"cactus\", \"wave\")\n\n# Randomize a vector\nsample(x = students, size = 3, replace = FALSE)\n```\n\n## [Function Tutorial: Pick Functions]{.gold} {.smaller}\n\n- Using order from `sample` we’ll claim one function each per round:\n    - Round 1: random order\n    - Round 2: reverse of Round 1 order\n    - Round 3: new random order\n\n\\\n\n. . .\n\n- Claimed functions should be entered in the Google Sheet I made for this\n\n\\\n\n. . .\n\n- We’ll go one by one so <u>do not enter functions</u> before your turn!\n\n## [Function Tutorial: Free Work]{.pink} {.smaller}\n\n- Make a new Quarto file for this assignment\n\n\\\n\n- Write in your three functions and which package(s) they come from\n\n\\\n\n- Remember to check their help file!\n    - `?function_name`\n\n\\\n\n- The help file also (sometimes) has examples at the bottom!\n    - Feel free to **_adapt_** these for your tutorial assignment `<svg aria-label=\"Face Smile\" role=\"img\" viewBox=\"0 0 512 512\" style=\"height:1em;width:1em;vertical-align:-0.125em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;font-size:inherit;fill:currentColor;overflow:visible;position:relative;\"><title>Face Smile</title><path d=\"M464 256A208 208 0 1 0 48 256a208 208 0 1 0 416 0zM0 256a256 256 0 1 1 512 0A256 256 0 1 1 0 256zm177.6 62.1C192.8 334.5 218.8 352 256 352s63.2-17.5 78.4-33.9c9-9.7 24.2-10.4 33.9-1.4s10.4 24.2 1.4 33.9c-22 23.8-60 49.4-113.6 49.4s-91.7-25.5-113.6-49.4c-9-9.7-8.4-24.9 1.4-33.9s24.9-8.4 33.9 1.4zM144.4 208a32 32 0 1 1 64 0 32 32 0 1 1 -64 0zm192-32a32 32 0 1 1 0 64 32 32 0 1 1 0-64z\"/></svg>`{=html}\n\n## [Temperature Check]{.purple}\n\n#### How are you Feeling?\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"comics/debugging.png\" alt=\"Comic-style graph depicting someone's emotional state as they debug code (from initial struggle and defeat to eventual triumph)\">\n</p>\n\n## [Upcoming Due Dates]{.blue} {.smaller}\n\n::::{.columns}\n:::{.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n### Due before lab\n\n#### (By midnight)\n\n- Muddiest Point \\#4\n\n:::\n:::{.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n### Due before lecture\n\n#### (By midnight)\n\n- Homework \\#4\n- Read [Model selection in ecology and evolution](https://www.uvm.edu/~bmitchel/NR385/Johnson_Model_selection.pdf)\n\n:::\n::::\n\n",
