### [Class Discussion]{.gold}

## [Today's Plan]{.blue}

- Joining Data
- Function Tutorials - Claim Functions!

## [Today's Learning Objectives]{.purple}

After today's session you will be able to:

. . .

- Name the four major types of joins
- Contrast / compare the four major types of joins
- Combine data using the four major types of joins

## [Join Background]{.orange} {.smaller}

- To test a hypothesis we often need to collect multiple types of data
    - But, virtually all statistical tools require _one_ data object

\

. . . 

- Somehow you need to combine data from multiple sources
    - Usually based on the contents of a shared column in _both_ sources

\

. . . 

- Matching two data objects like this is called "[joining]{.purple}"

## [Join Example]{.orange} {.smaller}

- You want to test how frogs are affected by rainfall

\

. . .

- You collect the following data:
    1. number of frogs at ponds
    2. daily rainfall at those ponds

\

. . . 

- Need to [join]{.purple} the frog abundance and rain amount data matched _by their pond_

## [Join Types]{.orange} {.smaller}

- Four major flavors of join:
    - Left / Right Join
    - Inner Join
    - Outer Join (sometimes also known as "full" or "full outer")
    - Anti Join

\

. . .

- Let's look at some example syntax
```{.r}
# Join frog and rain data by pond ID
combo_df <- left_join(x = frog_df, y = rain_df,
                      by = "pond_name")
```

## [Left Joins]{.orange}

- Left joins keep _all_ rows/columns found in "left" dataframe
    - Add on columns from "right" dataframe _if they have matching rows_ in "left"

. . .

<img src="images/graphic-join-left.png" alt="Table with an 'X' column and 'A' and 'B' rows gets joined with a second table with a 'Y' column and 'A' and 'C' rows to produce a single table with 'X' and Y' columns and 'A' and 'B' rows"  width="95%">

## [Right Joins]{.orange}

- Right joins keep _all_ rows/columns found in "right" dataframe
    - Add on columns from "left" dataframe _if they have matching rows_ in "right"

. . .

<img src="images/graphic-join-right.png" alt="Table with an 'X' column and 'A' and 'B' rows gets joined with a second table with a 'Y' column and 'A' and 'C' rows to produce a single table with 'X' and Y' columns and 'A' and 'C' rows" width="95%">

## [Join Example Data]{.gold} {.smaller}

- Before we practice our joins, let's review an example dataset I've created for this purpose

\

. . . 

- We are studying the effect of human impacts on lichens that grow on trees

\

. . .

- We collected two sets of data to test this hypothesis:
    1. The distance to the nearest road for 26 trees ("Tree_A" through "Tree_Z")
    2. The percent cover of the three major lichen types on 10 of those trees 

\

. . .

- Any questions on this study or these example datasets?

## [Practice: Left Joins]{.pink} {.smaller}

![](images/hex-dplyr.png){.absolute top=0 left=1100 width="12%" fig-alt="hex logo for the dplyr R package"}

- Download the "tree_lichen.csv" and "tree_road.csv" from the course page

\

. . . 

- Load them into R and check their structure
    - Remember to use the `read.csv` function


\

. . .

- Use a [**left** join]{.purple} to combine these two dataframes by tree ID
    - What is the structure of the resulting dataframe?

## [Inner Joins]{.orange}

- Inner joins keep columns from both left and right **but** only rows that are _found in both_
    - Useful when you only want to keep rows with complete data

. . .

<img src="images/graphic-join-inner.png" alt="Table with an 'X' column and 'A' and 'B' rows gets joined with a second table with a 'Y' column and 'A' and 'C' rows to produce a single table with 'X' and Y' columns and only an 'A' row" width="95%">

## [Outer Joins]{.orange} {.smaller}

- Outer joins keep columns from both left and right **and** _all rows_ 

. . .

<img src="images/graphic-join-outer.png" alt="Table with an 'X' column and 'A' and 'B' rows gets joined with a second table with a 'Y' column and 'A' and 'C' rows to produce a single table with 'X' and Y' columns and 'A', 'B', and 'C' rows" width="95%">

. . .

- This join type is also known as a "full join" or "full outer join"

## [Revisiting Lichen Data]{.gold}

- You decide to revisit your lichen / tree study

\

. . .

- Now you want to keep the tree road distances _whether or not_ you have lichen cover

\

. . .

- What kind of join should you use? Why?

## [Practice: Inner/Outer Joins]{.pink}

![](images/hex-dplyr.png){.absolute top=0 left=1100 width="12%" fig-alt="hex logo for the dplyr R package"}

- Use a [full join]{.purple} to combine the original lichen and road distance objects

\

. . .

- What is the structure of the resulting dataframe?

\

. . .

- How does this differ from the result of your **left** join earlier?

## [Anti Joins]{.orange}

- Anti joins keep columns from both left and right **but** only rows that are _**not**_ found in both

. . .

<img src="images/graphic-join-anti.png" alt="Table with an 'X' column and 'A' and 'B' rows gets joined with a second table with a 'Y' column and 'A' and 'C' rows to produce a single table with 'X' and Y' columns 'B' and 'C' rows" width="95%">

## [Re-revisiting Lichen Data]{.gold} {.smaller}

- You have just been awarded a grant to conduct more lichen research!
    - Congratulations!

\

. . .

- You decide to spend your grant on measuring lichen on all of the trees that you <u>did not</u> measure the first time

\

. . . 

- You need to join your old datasets to identify which trees you should measure with your new grant
    - What kind of join should you use? Why?

## [Practice: Anti Joins]{.pink} {.smaller}

![](images/hex-dplyr.png){.absolute top=0 left=1100 width="12%" fig-alt="hex logo for the dplyr R package"}

- Use an [anti join]{.purple} to combine the original lichen and road distance objects

\

- Which dataframe should be on the "left" and which should be "right"?
    - Does it matter?

\

. . .

- How many trees do you need to measure lichen on with your new funding?

## [Join Trivia - Question 1]{.gold} {.smaller}

- I have a table of [scorpion abundance]{.orange} and another of [desert temperatures]{.orange}

\

. . .

- I want to keep only scorpion values that _also_ have temperature
    - Which type of join should I use?

\

. . .

- Inner join!
    - Keeps only rows found in both dataframes

## [Join Trivia - Question 2]{.gold} {.smaller}

- I have a table of [bird species]{.orange} and another of [grass species]{.orange} at various plots

\

. . .

- I want to include all birds and grasses _regardless_ of whether both are in each plot
    - Which type of join should I use?

\

. . .

- Full join!
    - Keeps **all** rows found in either dataframe

## [Join Trivia - Question 3]{.gold} {.smaller}

- I have a table of [patient response to medication]{.orange} and another of [patients who indicated they don't want their data used]{.orange}

\

. . .

- I want to _remove_ medication response information for all patients who didn't give consent to use their data
    - Which type of join should I use?

\

. . .

- Anti join!
    - Keeps only rows **not** found in both data tables

## [Function Tutorial Assignment]{.gold} {.smaller}

- Picking functions today!

\

- Take a moment and get your 7-10 functions list ready
    - You may also want to pull up CRAN (just in case)

\

- Any lingering questions about this assignment?
    - Esp. any that need to be answered _before_ picking functions

## [Randomizing Vectors]{.orange} {.smaller}

- We'll use the `sample` function to randomize student order

\

. . . 

- `sample` has three main arguments:
    - `x` = vector to randomize
    - `size` = number of times to randomly sample
    - `replace` = whether vector elements can be retrieved more than once

\

. . .

- In our case:
    - `x` = vector of student names
    - `size` = number of students
    - `replace` = `FALSE` (don't want to double pick the same student)

## [Randomizing Vectors Demo]{.orange}

- Let's look at an example to clarify that

```{.r code-line-numbers="|2|5"}
# Make a vector of faux students
students <- c("albatross", "cactus", "wave")

# Randomize a vector
sample(x = students, size = 3, replace = FALSE)
```

## [Function Tutorial: Pick Functions]{.gold} {.smaller}

- Using order from `sample` we’ll claim one function each per round:
    - Round 1: random order
    - Round 2: reverse of Round 1 order
    - Round 3: new random order

\

. . .

- Claimed functions should be entered in the Google Sheet I made for this

\

. . .

- We’ll go one by one so <u>do not enter functions</u> before your turn!

## [Function Tutorial: Free Work]{.pink} {.smaller}

- Make a new Quarto file for this assignment

\

- Write in your three functions and which package(s) they come from

\

- Remember to check their help file!
    - `?function_name`

\

- The help file also (sometimes) has examples at the bottom!
    - Feel free to **_adapt_** these for your tutorial assignment `r fontawesome::fa("smile", a11y = "sem")`
