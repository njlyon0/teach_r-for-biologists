Even so, you’ve barely scratched the surface of what you can do with this programming language. If you want to continue your R journey (which I hope that you do!), there are a lot of good resources out there. I’m linking some below but remember too that simply Googling for particular tutorials is also a nice way of continuing your journey as a new data scientist.",

Developed and maintained by educators with clear learning objectives in mind. In particular you might find the Data Carpentries Lessons valuable. These include:\n\nData Skills for Ecologists\nWorking with Genomics Data\nGeospatial Data + R\nAnd many, many more!\n\n\n\nAnother R Course - SSECR\nIn my work with the Long Term Ecological Research Network (LTER) I got to help develop a course in data science and team science for graduate students called Synthesis Skills for Early Career Researchers (SSECR). This course covers some of the content we covered here but to a much greater depth. It also includes content we didn’t cover in this course but that you might find interesting (e.g., working with spatial data, creating interactive web apps with R, etc.). The course materials live here: lter.github.io/ssecr\n\n\nR & Python\nIf you’re interested in Python you could check out my R/Python Bilingualism website. I’ve developed a lot of demo code chunks their and demonstrated increasingly complex operations in both R and Python to help others in “translating” between the two languages. Incidentally there are also a lot of nice demonstrations of R topics that we did not cover in class so you could use that website and just ignore the Python facet.",

Remember to specifically load any necessary packages using the library function and include comments explaining what line(s) correspond to each of the following prompts.\n\nYou hypothesize that penguin flipper length differs between sexes and that the degree of difference between sexes is related to the species of penguin (i.e., sex and species are interacting). Test your hypothesis using the “penguins” dataset in the palmerpenguins package\n\nWhat is the name of the most appropriate statistical test? Why is it the correct test for this question?\nIn a code chunk, fit the model you have chosen and generate a summary table of the relevant information. Remember to remove any penguins that don’t have a recorded sex!\nBased on the summary table you just generated, is your hypothesis supported? What information in the summary table allows you to draw this conclusion?\n\nYou present on your work at a professional society’s annual meeting and people are really excited about this finding! A colleague approaches you afterwards and asks you whether you’ve used multi-model inference to check to see if including the home island of the penguin improves your model’s explanatory power. You realize this is a great idea and decide to pursue it immediately\n\nFit a model with sex and species interacting and add a term for island (no interaction term). Fit another model where sex, species, and island are all included as explanatory variables and they are all allowed to interact.\nUsing the AIC function, compare these two new models with your original model. Which model has the most explanatory power? How do you know?",

Remember to specifically load any necessary packages using the library function and include comments explaining what line(s) correspond to each of the following prompts.\n\nRecalling your exciting statistical discoveries on penguin flipper length relationship to sex, species, and island, you decide to make some publication quality figures to demonstrate your findings. Use the ggplot2 package to make the graphs and the palmerpenguins package for the “penguins” data.\n\nBegin by creating a violin plot with sex on the x axis and flipper length on the y axis. The violin blobs’ fill color should differ between the two sexes (default colors are fine!).\nThat graph was a fine first pass but you realize you’ve neglected to include penguin species information in the graph! Facet the graph to divide the plot into three panels (either rows or columns are fine)–one panel per species of penguin. Also, remove the gray background color (but keep the black axis lines!) and add custom axis titles that remove the underscores (“_“) in the raw column names.\n\nRemembering your colleague’s suggestion of evaluating the effect of island you decide to make a second graph where you visualize penguin flipper length at the three islands.\n\nCreate a violin plot where island is on the y axis and flipper length is on the x axis. Make the fill color of each violin different between islands. Remove the gray background color, keep black axis lines, and customize the axis titles so this graph visually matches your first graph.\nAfter making this graph you realize you are accidentally re-using the default ggplot2 red and blue colors. This could be very confusing to your audience so you definitely need to address it. Visit the Coolors website (coolors.co/palettes/trending) and pick a custom color for each of the three islands. Manually set the violin fill to give each island one of these three colors.\n\nYour two graphs are looking great! Now you just need to combine them into one file for ease of sharing to your peers. Use the cowplot package to put both graphs (the species by sex graph and the island graph) into one plot. These can be either side-by-side or one on top of the other depending on your preference.",

Remember to specifically load any necessary packages using the library function and include comments explaining what line(s) correspond to each of the following prompts.\n\nAt an international conference you meet a French colleague also interested in penguin research. They’re very excited after your recent string of findings (and beautiful graphs) and want to plan a visit to the states to visit several researchers in your field. However, they intuitively think in Celsius (C) and would love your help with an R script that converts Fahrenheit (F) to their preferred temperature units\n\nCreate an object containing the number 35. Using that object, convert it to Celsius and print that converted value. The conversion formula is as follows: C = (F - 32) x 5/9\nYour colleague is very appreciative of your quick calculation but realizes it might be easier to convert a set of temperatures from C to F so that they can keep that range in mind. Write a for loop that converts 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, and 95°F into their equivalents in C and prints the result\nYou’re happy with this loop but you don’t think the raw temperatures are going to be very useful to your colleague’s planning. Add a conditional to the loop where if the temperature in Celsius is less than or equal to 18 a message is printed that includes (1) the temp in Fahrenheit and (2) a note to your colleague that they should plan on packing a jacket. If the temperature is greater than 18°C, the message should still include the temp in F and can tell them not to worry about bringing a jacket\nWhether or not to bring a jacket is a rather coarse assessment of temperature though! Add more conditionals such that (A) if temperature is less than 18°C the message includes the note about bringing a jacket, (B) if temperature is greater than or equal to 23°C the message is that they should pack shorts, or (C) if temperature is between 18 and 23°C that neither shorts nor a jacket is required. All three message options should also include the temperature in Fahrenheit for that iteration of the loop (same as question 1c)",

Rather than providing a rubric with various standards of work (as was done for the other assignments) your GitHub presence will be evaluated as a checklist where the presence (or absence) of each item on the list will be worth a certain point value. You may want to print out this list and cross off rows in the rubric below as you add that component.\nThe following sub-sections are included in this assignment\n\nProfile – 10 points\nSpecial Repository – 10 points\n\nWhen you make a GitHub repository that has the same name as your profile it is a “special repository.” See an example here.\nThe README.md file for that repository becomes the top of your public profile and helps orient visitors to your profile to the stuff about yourself / your work that you’d like to highlight\n\nPortfolio Repository – 20 points\n\nThis repository will contain–at minimum–your revised function tutorial\nI recommend also including any homework assignments on which you earn 8-10 points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nItem\nPoints\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nProfile\nName\n2\nName you’d like employers to use\n\n\nProfile\nBiography\n2\nOne-sentence description of your professional background\n\n\nProfile\nCompany\n1\nIf you have a post-college position already, put that. Otherwise put your university\n\n\nProfile\nHometown\n1\nIf you are moving after college and know where, put that city. If not, put the city of your university\n\n\nProfile\nSocial Account\n1\nLink one social account of your choosing (e.g., LinkedIn, etc.). Pick an account you want employers to know about\n\n\nProfile\nPhoto\n2\nInclude a profile photo. Doesn’t need to be a photo of you but that is recommended. Do not use a group photo where it is unclear which person you are.\n\n\nSpecial Repository\nExists\n1\nRepository with the same name as your profile was created.\n\n\nSpecial Repo.\nREADME Exists\n1\nRepository has a README.md file\n\n\nSpecial Repo.\nWelcome - in README\n2\nWelcome message to visitors that includes your name\n\n\nSpecial Repo.\nCurrent Role - in README\n2\nExplains your current position, and list some of your research interests (1-3 sentences)\n\n\nSpecial Repo.\nCareer Goals - in README\n2\nBriefly summarize your career goals in the next 5 years (1-3 sentences). Write as if you were answering this question in an interview\n\n\nSpecial Repo.\nExplain Portfolio - in README\n3\nExplain your portfolio repository and highlight 1-2 major files in that repository that you’d want employers to use as an example of you work’s quality\n\n\nPortfolio Repository\nRepository Exists\n1\nRepository with the word “portfolio” was created\n\n\nPortfolio Repo.\nRepository Pinned to Profile\n1\nUp to four repositories can be “pinned” on your profile which makes them easy for visitors to find. Your portfolio repository must be pinned\n\n\nPortfolio Repo.\nREADME Exists\n1\nPortfolio repository has a README file\n\n\nPortfolio Repo.\nREADME Content\n4\nREADME includes a brief (1-3 sentence) description of all files included in the repository. Each file’s explanation should include (A) name of file, (B) what the file does, and (C) why you created the file (i.e., for an assignment? Fun? Work?)\n\n\nPortfolio Repo.\nFunction Tutorial Included\n8\nFinal draft of your function tutorial is included in the portfolio repository (and properly explained by the README of that repository)\n\n\nPortfolio Repo.\nHomework Included\n5\nAt least one homework assignment is included in the portfolio repository (and properly explained by the README). Feel free to include as many homework assignments as you’d like; only one is required but more is often better!",

    "text": "Artificial Intelligence\nArtificial intelligence (AI) tools are increasingly entering public consciousness. These tools (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.) often market themselves as a mode of increasing efficiency or making code operations easier. While this may or may not be true for experienced programmers, I strongly discourage the use of AI tools for this class. I feel this way for two reasons:\n\nI believe shortcuts–like AI–will undercut your learning. A vital bit of learning any new skill is engaging your problem solving skills to develop an intuition about how concepts fit together. If you overly rely on AI tools you will directly inhibit this process and–in extreme cases–may not be able to accomplish coding tasks in contexts where AI tools are inappropriate (e.g., job interviews, with clients, etc.).\nThere are ethical considerations around AI that are not well-discussed. This course is not flexible enough to also be a primer in AI ethics so it is better to just avoid using these tools until you have the chance to educate yourselves and make an informed decision for yourself. If this topic area is of interest to you, I recommend doing a Google Scholar search for the peer-reviewed articles being published on this topic. Your institution may also offer an ethics or bioethics course (often in the Philosophy department or cross-listed there) if you’d prefer a trained ethicist help you develop formal knowledge in this sphere.\n\n\nAI Policy Enforcement Note\nI became an educator because I get joy from supporting new learners. I definitely know that I wouldn’t be where I am today without some passionate mentors and teachers who believed in me and supported my development in the very first steps of my career. Because of this philosophy, I am not interested in “policing” students. I will not make any attempt to restrict how you use the internet nor will I turn this class into a mini surveillance state in an attempt to prevent the use of AI tools or other forms of “cheating”.\nIf you find that you are struggling in this course and feel pressured to use AI tools to succeed, please come talk to me so that we can discuss reasonable accommodations for you to succeed under your own power and intellect.",

    "text": "Required Course Materials\n\nR (cran.r-project.org)\n\nI recognize that this website is very bare bones, but this program is the industry standard and enjoys the support of a large and active population of users. When you are troubleshooting (i.e., “debugging”) your code you will very much appreciate the breadth of people who are also using R. Follow the “Download R for …” link for your computer operating system (i.e., Mac vs. Windows vs. Linux) to install R.\n\nRStudio Desktop (posit.co/downloads)\n\nRStudio is the preferred platform for working in R; as the R website showed, so-called “base R” can be a little basic. RStudio will provide several helpful bells and whistles that will make the program easier to work with and easier on the eyes!\n\nGit & GitHub\n\nGit (an application like R) and GitHub (a website) will be a part of the course, but you do not need to do anything with them before we cover them in class! Installing Git can be a little annoying for those without command line (a.k.a. “terminal”, “shell”, or “bash”) experience. We’ll cover working with Git and GitHub together a few weeks into the course. If you feel so moved, you are welcome to try to install Git (see instructions here) and make a profile on GitHub on your own, but doing it alone is optional so don’t worry if you can’t get it to work before we cover it in class!\n\nMiscellaneous peer-reviewed articles / book excerpts\n\nI will provide any readings for the course in PDF format, so check the Canvas/etc. page regularly to download the necessary files. Any required readings will be posted at least one week before we discuss it in class. I’ll also do my best to link directly to the readings from this website!",

Such assignments are meant to allow you space to think critically about what concepts from that day you felt confident with and which you struggled with (i.e., which were “muddier”)\nNote that if everything was clear in a given lesson then substituting a follow-up question that goes beyond the lecture materials is appropriate!\nThere will be eight (8) equally weighted muddiest point responses\n\nThese will be graded according to this rubric\n\nAll muddiest point responses will be due by midnight the day before each lab (i.e., one day after the lecture to which they are responding)\n\nMy hope is this will be helpful to you in clearly remembering which topics did or did not make sense to you\nAdditionally, this tight turn around will let me re-cover concepts in lab that several students identify as their muddiest point from that week’s lecture\n\n\n\n\nWeekly Homework\n\nThere will be eight (8) equally weighted homework assignments\n\nThese will be graded according to this rubric\n\nHomework numbers 1 through 7 will be assigned after lecture and due before the following lecture at midnight (i.e., 7 days)\n\nHomework 8 will be assigned after lecture and due before lab of that week (i.e., 3 days) because there won’t be a lecture after that one\n\nI will give you feedback on these assignments that you are welcome to implement so that you can include those revised homework assignments in your GitHub portfolio (see “GitHub Presence” below)\n\n\n\nGitHub Presence\n\nA full rubric for this assignment is available here but the summarized description below may prove helpful in setting expectations\nThis assignment includes two parts: (1) a fleshed-out GitHub profile including a ‘special repository’ that serves as a landing page for visitors to your profile and (2) a portfolio repository that includes (at least) your revised R Package Report\n\nDon’t worry if some of those vocabulary terms are alien to your right now, we will cover them in class/lab, and you will be well-prepared to tackle this component\nYour portfolio repository should also include any homework assignments that you receive a 9 or 10 on (or revise following a score)\n\nThis assignment is meant both to give you some working knowledge of Git/GitHub and to serve as a tangible resource that you can share with prospective employers and add to your resume and/or curriculum vitae (CV)\n\n\n\nR Function Tutorials\n\nA full rubric for this assignment is available here\nFirst Draft\n\nStudents will pick three functions from R package(s) available on CRAN (i.e., “official” R packages)\nYou will then create a tutorial of these three functions aimed at an interested but non-specialist audience (i.e., your classmates) in an R Markdown file\nThis tutorial should be self-contained and support copy/pasting of code that runs for your classmates / me\nYou may begin work on this assignment whenever you wish though you may wish to wait until we cover R Markdown files in the early weeks of the course\nRoughly halfway through the course, you will share your R Markdowns with your classmates and walk us through your tutorial\nYour classmates will provide positive and constructively critical feedback on your tutorial\n\nRevision\n\nYou will have two weeks to implement any changes your classmates suggest by emphasizing strengths and addressing weaknesses indicated by your peers\nYou will then get to present your revised tutorial and receive more feedback\n\n\n\n\nParticipation\nRecognizing that not everyone is equally comfortable speaking in front of a group, communication is still a crucial skill in virtually any career path. I strongly encourage you to take advantage of this course to get out of your comfort zone and try to develop that skill while in a safe environment if it is not your natural inclination. That being said, your participation grade will not be entirely dependent upon contributing to conversation and there will be other ways to grow as a communicator in this course.\n\nYour participation score includes:\n\nAsking questions in class (both verbally and in the Zoom chat)\nUseful written feedback to peers on either draft of their R package reports",

Each muddiest point assignment should be relatively short, and all iterations of this assignment share the guidelines and rubric outlined in this document.\nEach muddiest point must address the following three questions:\n\nWhat topic covered in the last lecture/lab really “clicked” for you? What other concepts do you mentally connect that topic with?\nWhat topic covered in the last lecture/lab did you struggle to understand? What about the concept made it difficult for you to grasp?\nWhat questions do you have about the concept you struggled with that—if answered—would help clarify things for you?\n\nAll three questions must be answered, and each response should be sufficiently detailed for me to understand where you’re feeling confident versus what topics we may need to carve out extra in-class time to cover.\nRemember: there are no dumb questions! If you struggled with a topic, the odds are good that at least one other person struggled with the same thing. Asking instructors to re-cover materials can be an act of bravery and those of your peers struggling with the same question(s) will be appreciative that you brought it up!",

Remember to specifically load any necessary packages using the library function and include comments explaining what line(s) correspond to each of the following prompts.\n\nIn your own words, explain the purpose of the YAML of an R Markdown file. What does it do / what is it for?\nImagine you’re working on an R Markdown file. You set one code chunk to include = FALSE. What will happen to the contents of that code chunk when you knit the file? What parts–if any–of the code chunk will be displayed in the knit file?\nYou are studying native bee populations and need to wrangle your dataset to be ready for someone else to take on analysis. This question has multiple parts, be sure to answer all components! Each sub-question should be in its own code chunk.\n\nLoad the dplyr and magrittr packages and read in the example bee data (“bees.csv”) into R and check its structure. How many rows / columns are there?\nYour advisor reminds you that 2021 was a tough year for field research and those data are likely not reliable. Use the filter function to remove all data on bees identified in 2021.\nYou also realize that your methods are not well-suited to capturing kleptoparasitic bee abundance so those values are not reliable enough to pass on to analysis. Use the select function to remove this column from the subset you just created.\nYou feel that the data you have now are clean enough to continue. However, your collaborator wants a column for the total bee abundance in each year. Use the mutate function to create the column your collaborator has requested from the data version created by the above step.\nYour collaborator loves the final data product you created! But they looked at your code and they think it can be streamlined. Copy the code you just wrote (filter, select, and mutate) and use the pipe operator (%&gt;%) to write a version that does all three steps without creating intermediary objects. Check the structure of the final object.\n\nYour data wrangling skills are so impressive to your collaborator that they ask for your help with a lichen project they have been working on. This question has multiple parts, be sure to answer all components! Each sub-question should be in its own code chunk.\n\nLoad the tidyr package and read in the example lichen data (“tree_lichen.csv”) into R and check its structure? What columns are included?\nYour collaborator tells you that they have already cleaned the data but the data shape isn’t exactly what they need. They want your help reshaping the data into long format. Use the pivot_longer function to reshape their data so that they have the following three columns: “tree” unchanged from the wide format version; “lichen_type” which includes whether the lichen is crustose, foliose, or fruticose; “percent_cover” which includes the percent cover values your collaborator measured in the field.\nCheck the structure of the long format object you created. How many rows are there?",

Finally, some plants had some issues that your friend recorded in a third file just in case they needed to account for that in the statistics later on. This question has multiple parts, be sure to answer all components! Each sub-question should be in its own code chunk.\n\nLoad the dplyr package and read in the three data files they shared with you: (1) “tomato.csv”, “tomato_treatment.csv”, and “tomato_issues.csv”. Check the structure of all three files.\nYour friend first wants you to attach the treatment information to the main data file. Do this with a join (by plant) so that no rows are lost and check the structure of the resulting object.\nYour friend has decided they do want to drop some of the plants that had issues after all. They want to remove the problem plants if they had either herbivore damage or a fungal infection (they are okay including over-watered plants in the final data). Using filter and an appropriate join of your choice, remove the plants your friend wants excluded from the data object you created in the previous part of this question. Check the structure of this object.\n\nLet’s revisit the penguin data from the palmerpenguins package to practice some statistics! This question has multiple parts, be sure to answer all components! Each sub-question should be in its own code chunk.\n\nLoad the palmerpenguins package and check the structure of the penguins data object.\nFor all columns, identify whether each column is “discrete” (aka “categorical”) or “continuous”.\nNow that you’ve identified the data type of each column, let’s do some statistics! Your hypothesis is that flipper length differs between male and female penguins. Fit the correct test and run summary on the model fit object. Was your hypothesis supported? How do you know? (Remember you can check the “roadmap” we covered in class!)\nYou hypothesize that penguins with a higher body mass have longer flippers. Fit the correct test and run summary on the model fit object. Was your hypothesis supported? How do you know?",

Remember to specifically load any necessary packages using the library function and include comments explaining what line(s) correspond to each of the following prompts.\n\nYour French colleague (for whom you calculated a number of temperature conversions last week) reaches out to you again with one final request: they would like you to write a function for them in R that converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit so that they can stop bothering you to do the conversion for them. Note that last week you converted F to C and this week is the opposite!\n\nIn a code chunk, convert 22°C into Fahrenheit. Feel free to Google the formula. Also, note that you may want to be careful to use parentheses to make sure the order of operations is correct.\nIdentify which part of that formula should be replaced with an object (i.e., what part of the formula will become an argument). In another code chunk, copy your conversion formula and replace the relevant part(s) with objects.\nUse R’s function syntax to make your scripted formula into a working function. Define the function (i.e., assign it to an object) in a code chunk.\nUse your new custom function to convert 5°C and 35°C into their equivalents in Fahrenheit in a final code chunk.",
