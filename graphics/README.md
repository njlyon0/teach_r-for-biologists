# Programming in R for Biologists - Graphics

I created a number of the graphics in this course, mostly either to use colors that fit the color scheme of the slide decks or because I needed a visual for something that wasn't readily findable online. For simple graphics, I find Microsoft PowerPoint is sufficient so I've committed the file (.pptx) in which I design _all_ such graphics.

Each slide contains only _one_ graphic and includes a text note indicating to which slide deck the graphic belongs. I edit those graphics, then select the relevant objects in the slide, export as a PNG, and move them to the appropriate subfolder of the "materials" directory.
